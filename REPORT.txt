- How did you design your benchmarks?
I made the benchmark for populate.cpp modify every byte so that every page ended
up getting loaded anyways.

I made the benchmark for huge.cpp modify every 4kbs of a 2mb "file".

- What performance differences did you see?
The performance differences for populate.cpp were inconsistent, but the demand paging
was generally slower for this, by around .0002 seconds. 

The performance for huge.pp, when using big pages it was multiple times faster than
using regular size pages;


- If you have time / interest, lets try to look at what exactly caused these
performance differences above. Our hardware has special performance counters
for measuring certain events such as number of cache misses, cycles per
instruction, etc. We can use these counters ourselves using the perf
commandline tool. `perf list` will print a list of all the counters your
hardware + OS support. Which counters did you find most interesting? What
results did you observe?
